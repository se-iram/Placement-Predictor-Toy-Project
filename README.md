# Student Placement Prediction
This project predicts whether a student will be placed based on their **IQ** and **CGPA**, using a **Logistic Regression** model.
Note: This is a practice/toy project created to understand the complete flow of building an end-to-end machine learning project. The dataset, model, and predictions are for learning purposes only.

## Features
- Uses a toy dataset for demonstration.
- Logistic Regression for binary classification.
- Predicts placement probability.
- Saving it with pickle.

## Steps Performed
- Preprocessing + EDA + Feature engineering
- Extract input and output cols
- Scale the values
- Train test split
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model
- Deploy the model
